Good day Bradley,

Thank you for contacting the AWS Premium Support Team, 
my name is Hastings and I will be assisting with your case today. 

From my point of view you are trying to launch a t3.large instance type from your custom AMI(0417d1e320e7cfc0b),
but however you are unable to select it because it is grayed out.

After reviewing your AMI, l have noticed that your AMI is using Paravirtual Virtualization instead of HVM(Hardware Virtual Machine) which
does not support current generation instance types(t3.large included).

Therefore l would suggest that you use a different AMI which supports HVM instead of Paravirtual.

Best Regards Hastings.






















The customer is using a custom AMI, which supports Paravirtual Virtualization.
Paravirtual is not supported on most of the current generation instance types.
